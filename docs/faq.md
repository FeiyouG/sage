# FAQ

## Is Sage always running?

On Claude Code, yes - it loads automatically via hooks on every session. On Cursor/VS Code, you need to explicitly enable protection via the command palette. On OpenClaw, it runs once installed as a plugin.

## What happens if Sage encounters an error?

Sage fails open. Any internal error (API timeout, config parse failure, etc.) results in an `allow` verdict. Hooks always exit 0. The agent is never blocked due to a Sage bug.

## Does Sage send my code to the cloud?

No. Sage sends URL hashes and package hashes to reputation APIs. File content, commands, and source code stay local. See [Privacy](privacy.md) for details.

## How do I handle false positives?

When Sage shows an `ask` verdict, you can choose to proceed. The artifact is then eligible for allowlisting so it will not be flagged again. The allowlist is stored at `~/.sage/allowlist.json`.

## Can I add custom threat rules?

Not yet. Custom user threat definitions (`~/.sage/threats/`) are planned but not yet implemented. Currently, only the rules shipped in `threats/` are used.

## Does Sage work offline?

Partially. Local heuristics (pattern matching against YAML rules) work fully offline. URL reputation and package checks require network access but degrade gracefully - if the API is unreachable, Sage falls back to heuristics only.

## What about MCP tool calls?

MCP tool call interception (`mcp__*`) is planned but not yet implemented. Currently Sage only intercepts the built-in tools listed in [How It Works](how-it-works.md#intercepted-tools).

## How do I disable Sage temporarily?

- **Claude Code:** Uninstall the plugin or run Claude without `--plugin-dir`
- **Cursor/VS Code:** Run `Sage: Disable Protection` from the command palette
- **OpenClaw:** Uninstall the plugin via `openclaw plugins uninstall sage`

You can also disable individual features in `~/.sage/config.json` (e.g. set `url_check.enabled` to `false`).

## Why does OpenClaw flag Sage as "potential-exfiltration"?

This is a false positive. OpenClaw's `code_safety` audit fires when `readFile` and `fetch` coexist in the same bundle. Sage reads local files (config, cache, YAML) and separately sends URL hashes to a reputation API. No file content crosses the network.
