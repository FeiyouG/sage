## What Data Is Sent

Sage uses Gen Digital cloud services for two purposes:

1. **URL reputation** - URLs extracted from tool calls are sent to a reputation API for malware/phishing/scam classification.
2. **File reputation** - Package hashes (SHA-256) from npm/PyPI registries are checked against a file reputation service.

## What Data Stays Local

- Source code and file contents are never transmitted
- Commands and command arguments stay local
- File paths stay local
- Threat definition matching (heuristics) runs entirely locally
- The verdict cache, allowlist, and audit log are local files

## Configuration

Both URL and file reputation checks can be disabled in `~/.sage/config.json`:

```json
{
  "url_check": { "enabled": false },
  "file_check": { "enabled": false }
}
```

With both disabled, Sage operates fully offline using only local heuristics.
