# Trusted installer domains for Sage
#
# Pipe-to-shell commands (curl | bash) targeting these domains are suppressed
# from CLT-CMD-001, CLT-CMD-002, CLT-SUPPLY-001, and CLT-SUPPLY-004 heuristic matches.
#
# Only dedicated installer endpoints are listed here — generic hosting
# platforms (e.g. raw.githubusercontent.com) are deliberately excluded.
#
# Format: list of {domain, reason} entries. Domains are matched by suffix
# with dot boundary (e.g. "bun.sh" matches "cdn.bun.sh" but not "notbun.sh").
